> Keywords:

 * Installed on a central build server to let developers know the changed source code and trigger a build / run tests

 * Continuous Integration : a development practice that require developers to integrate code into shared repository at regular intervals. This is to prevent finding an issue AFTER problem has occurred. This means there must be frequent build cycle. Usually this means code commit->build.
