## Reviews on Trying out Symfony(2)

Symfony does not have core component that works with Databases. Instead, it uses third-party library called Doctrine.
Doctrine allows building database schema through `Entity Class`, retrieving it, and more.
Symfony commands through bin/console can connect to various functionalities of Doctrine.
