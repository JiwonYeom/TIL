# Split Diff Package
Short introduction of a package for those who are looking for comparison functions in Atom.

1. Install the `split-diff` package.
2. Open the file you want to compare with another.
3. Press `alt+ctrl+T`. This will open the comparable section for you.
4. Paste the codes that you want to compare.

Done! At first I was about to install a merge tool, but I decided to keep things simple for this time, so I decided to just take this one. Simple and clean ;)

[Here's the link](https://atom.io/packages/split-diff) to the package.
