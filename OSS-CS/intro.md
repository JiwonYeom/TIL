## OSS Computer Science Project Progress

Contents in this folder are records of my progress in OSS Computer Science self-learning project.

I'm modifying parts of process management in this project, because I have already experienced programming to some extent as a job.

1. I'll be using additional folder to record my learnings instead of Trello as suggested here.
2. I'll be skipping some parts of courses that are redundant or very familiar to me. If I find out I will need the part, I'll go back and review the skipped materials. (mostly introductory courses)
3. I might be jumping back and forth between courses, since I want to quickly pick up the knowledge I need when I face difficulty while I'm working.
