### Progress Report (20170912)
\**Note:* I have taken CS50 already last year, so I'm excluding it.

#### 1. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python
- Python Basics, Core Elements of Programs, Simple Algorithms
- Some exercises solved.
- Tested Python on Git bash + Windows (just to see)
- Set up Anaconda & Spyder
- Felt like they were quite doable, since I'm already familiar with basic level loops and conditionals.
