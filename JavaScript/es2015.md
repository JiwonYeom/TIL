#### 1. keyword `let`

`Hoisting`: JavaScript moves all `var` declarations to the top of each scope.
This can cause some unexpected behaviors.

To prevent this, `let` keyword can be used. These are **not hoisted**.
They will stay within their blocks.

(examples will be added)

`let` cannot be redeclared within same scope.
