# ES2015 (ES6)

*reference to codeschool's es2015 course.*

#### 1. keyword `let`

`Hoisting`: JavaScript moves all `var` declarations to the top of each scope.
This can cause some unexpected behaviors.

To prevent this, `let` keyword can be used. These are **not hoisted**.
They will stay within their blocks.

(examples will be added)

`let` cannot be redeclared within same scope.

`let` is not shared in `for` loops, preventing callbacks to share values.

ex)
```JavaScript

// var
function loadProfiles(userNames){
  for(var i in userNames){
    _fetchProfile('/users/'+userNames[i], function(){
      console.log("Fetched for ", userNames[i]);
    });
  }
  // here, ALL outputs will be same since _fetchProfile gets iterated BEFORE callback. i will be the last value after for loop.
}

//let
function loadProfiles(userNames){
  for(let i in userNames){
    _fetchProfile('/users/'+userNames[i], function(){
      //does not share i, and new variable is made in each loop
      console.log("Fetched for ", userNames[i]);
    });
  }
}
```

#### 2. keyword `const`

literals can be inefficient

1) hard to tell if repeated literals mean the same thing

2) No clear meaning

* use `const` instead to make meanings clear and make it read-only.

* `const` should be initialized when made

* `const` is scoped to nearest block, just like `let`


#### 3. using default parameters

```JavaScript
function convertName(input=''){
  let name = input + '@gmail.com';
  console.log(name);
}
```

#### 4. Options Object

allows user-defined settings to be passed to a function in the form of properties on an object.

(like a constructor?)

```JavaScript
function setProfile(specification, options = {}){
  // options here is unclear

  //boilerplate code (wil be repeated)
  let skills = options.skills;
  let minWage = options.minWage;
  let nationality = options.nationality;
}

setProfile("newcomer requirements", {
    skills : true,
    minWage : 150,
    nationality : "Asian"
});
```

\*boilerplate code or boilerplate refers to sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration

instead, use *named parameters*

```JavaScript
function setProfile(specification, {skills, minWage, nationality}){
  let skills = skills;
  let minWage = minWage;
  let nationality = nationality;
}

setProfile("newcomer requirements", {
    skills : true,
    minWage : 150,
    nationality : "Asian"
});

// some options can be excluded. Not all needs to be included. But option object needs to be included as a whole.
setProfile("newcomer requirements", {
    nationality : "Asian"
});

// To exclude option object as a whole, set a default value.
function setProfile(specification, {skills, minWage, nationality} = {}){
  let skills = skills;
  let minWage = minWage;
  let nationality = nationality;
}

setProfile('new specs');

```
