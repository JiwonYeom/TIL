#### 1. keyword `let`

`Hoisting`: JavaScript moves all `var` declarations to the top of each scope.
This can cause some unexpected behaviors.

To prevent this, `let` keyword can be used. These are **not hoisted**.
They will stay within their blocks.

(examples will be added)

`let` cannot be redeclared within same scope.

`let` is not shared in `for` loops, preventing callbacks to share values.

ex)
```JavaScript

// var
function loadProfiles(userNames){
  for(var i in userNames){
    _fetchProfile('/users/'+userNames[i], function(){
      console.log("Fetched for ", userNames[i]);
    });
  }
  // here, ALL outputs will be same since _fetchProfile gets iterated BEFORE callback. i will be the last value after for loop.
}

//let
function loadProfiles(userNames){
  for(let i in userNames){
    _fetchProfile('/users/'+userNames[i], function(){
      //does not share i, and new variable is made in each loop
      console.log("Fetched for ", userNames[i]);
    });
  }
}
```

#### 2. keyword `const`
