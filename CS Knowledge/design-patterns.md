Reference: https://www.udacity.com/course/software-development-process--ud805

### Fundamental patterns
* Delegation pattern
* Interface pattern
* Proxy pattern

### Creational patterns
* Abstract factory pattern
* Factory method pattern
    * Intent: Create objects without specifying their class
    * When class cannot anticipate the type of object to be created.(until the compile moment)
    * class wants its subclass to specify the type of object to be created
    * Class needs control over the creation of its objects
* Lazy initialization
* Singleton pattern

### Structural patterns
* Adapter pattern
* Bridge pattern
* Decorator pattern

### Behavioral patterns
* Chain of responsibility
* Iterator
* Observer 
* State
* Strategy
    * Intent: allow switching between different algorithms to finish certain task
    * applicable for different variants of algorithms
    * many related classes that differ only in their behavior

* Visitor

### Concurrency patterns
* Active Object
* Monitor object 
* Thread Pool pattern
