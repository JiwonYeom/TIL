* Servers: Modern form of once much larger computers. Usually accessed only via network. They usually carry large workload. 
* Embedded Computers: largest class of computers.
    * widest range of applications & performance

* Warehouse Scale Computers(WSC): giant datacenters foro cloud computing

#### 8 Great ideas in computer architecture
* Moore's Law: integrated circuit resources double every 18-24 months.
* Abstraction for simplified design
* Make common case fast : enhances performance better than optimizing the rare case.. You will know what the common case is only through careful experimentation and measurement.
* performance via parallelism
* performance via pipelining
* performance via prediction
* hierarchy of memories
* Dependability via redundancy

#### Below your program
* OS
    * Handle basic input & output
    * allocate storage & memory
    * provide protected sharing of the computer among multiple applications, using them simultaneously.
* Compiler: translation of high-level language programs to the language that hardware can execute.
