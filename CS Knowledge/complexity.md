# Time Complexity
### What is Time and Space complexity?
- How to calculate running time
    - Running time of the Algorithm depends on things like 
        1) Machine's processor
        2) Memory speed
        3) 32bit / 64 bit?
        4) Input
        5) Etc
    - But time complexity only takes concern in **input**.

1. Define model machine. (Single Processor, 32 bit, sequential execution, 1 unit time for arithmetical and logical operations, 1 unit to assign, 1 unit to return)
