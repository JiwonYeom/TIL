## Walkthrough of `Set.add()` from HackerRank

This is a simple exercise for `sets` in Python.
I wrote my code in Python3, and here goes nothing!

```Python
"""first input line is number of countries. Use that to get all the inputs"""
totalNum = int(input())
"""declare initial country set"""
countrySet = set()
for i in range(1,totalNum):
    val = input()
    countrySet.add(val)
print(len(list(countrySet)))
```

Quite straightforward and easy!
