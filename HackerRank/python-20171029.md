## Walkthrough of `No Idea!` from HackerRank
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/no-idea

This is a simple question solvable using array and set.

*Note: Set contains elements that do NOT repeat.  All elements should be unique.

Given 4 sets of inputs:
1. number of numbers in an array that needs to be reviewed + number of elements in sets
2. numbers to be reviewed
3. numbers in set A
4. numbers in set B

For each number in the array (input number 2), if number is in A, add one to happiness. If in B, minus one from happiness.

* Variables needed
    - happiness variable
    - array of numbers
    - two sets

code:
```
# skipping the first line of input - irrelevant
input()

# result - initializing the happiness level
result = 0

# Covert to array - second input
inputArr = input().split()

# Convert to sets - third and fourth input
setA = set(input().split())
setB = set(input().split())

for el in inputArr:
    if el in setA:
        result+= 1
    elif el in setB:
        result-= 1

print(result)
```

Going over others' answers, it seems like it might be better if each elements are handled to be an integer

```
inputArr = list(map(int,input().split()))
```
